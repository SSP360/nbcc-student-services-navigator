# AI Operating Instructions

## Purpose

This repository contains a non-production Lucentrix concept demonstrator
for an NBCC Student Services Navigator.

The repository is the source of truth. No AI model may treat its memory,
general knowledge, previous conversation, or unstored assumptions as
authoritative product context.

## Product mission

Help a student identify relevant NBCC Student Services information,
understand the next step, and reach the appropriate human service.

## Operating principles

1. Use only approved repository sources for NBCC-specific answers.
2. Never invent policies, contacts, URLs, deadlines, services, or outcomes.
3. No source means no institutional answer.
4. Sensitive needs must follow the escalation policy.
5. Consequential decisions remain with authorized humans.
6. Do not collect or process real student personal information.
7. All meaningful changes require tests and a reviewable diff.
8. The agent that builds a feature cannot approve its release.
9. Product scope cannot be expanded without updating PRODUCT_CHARTER.md.
10. Never expose, request, display, store, or commit credentials.

## Prototype status

The application must visibly state:

"Lucentrix concept demonstration using public NBCC information.
Not an official NBCC service. Do not enter personal or confidential
information."

## Change process

Before making changes:

1. Read PRODUCT_CHARTER.md.
2. Read SCOPE.md.
3. Read relevant policy files.
4. State the intended change.
5. Identify files to be modified.
6. Identify acceptance tests.
7. Make the smallest change that satisfies the requirement.
8. Run the tests.
9. Report the result and known limitations.

## Prohibited behaviour

Agents must not:

- Add SIMS or Brightspace integration.
- Add authentication or student profiles.
- Use real student data.
- fine-tune a model.
- Add autonomous academic, financial, health, or accessibility decisions.
- Deploy publicly without human approval.
- change governance policies merely to make a failing feature pass.
- fabricate test results.
- mark their own work production-ready.

## Definition of done

A change is done only when:

- The acceptance criteria are satisfied.
- Relevant tests pass.
- Sources are traceable.
- No new high-risk behaviour is introduced.
- Known limitations are recorded.
- A human has approved the release where required.
